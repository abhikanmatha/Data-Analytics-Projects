# COVID-19 Dashboard

## Project Summary

### Introduction
This project focuses on creating a COVID-19 dashboard to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) related to the pandemic, such as positive cases and death counts. The dashboard provides an interactive and informative way to monitor the spread and impact of the virus. The project showcases my expertise in data visualization, dashboard development, and data analysis.

### Key Steps

1. Data Collection and Preparation:
   - Gathered relevant COVID-19 data from reliable sources, such as government health agencies or public datasets.
   - Cleaned and transformed the raw data into a suitable format for visualization.

2. Dashboard Design and Development:
   - Utilized Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool, to design and develop the COVID-19 dashboard.
   - Created calculated fields and parameters to calculate and display KPIs, such as positive case counts and death counts.
   - Designed interactive features and filters to allow users to explore the data dynamically.

3. Data Visualization and Analysis:
   - Visualized the COVID-19 data using various charts, graphs, and maps to present key insights and trends.
   - Implemented dynamic visualizations that update in real-time as new data becomes available.
   - Conducted in-depth analysis of the data to identify patterns, hotspots, and other important observations.

### Conclusion
This project showcases my skills in data visualization, dashboard development, and data analysis by creating an interactive COVID-19 dashboard. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of key metrics related to the pandemic, allowing users to monitor the spread and impact of the virus easily.
