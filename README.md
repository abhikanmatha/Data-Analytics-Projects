# Data Analytics Portfolio

## Introduction

Hello! Welcome to my data analytics portfolio. I'm passionate about leveraging data to gain insights and solve complex business problems. This portfolio showcases a collection of my projects, demonstrating my expertise in various domains of data analytics.

## Projects

### Cloud Data Pipelines (Google BigQuery, dbt, Tableau)

Automated the loading of Airlines data from Amazon S3 into a cloud data warehouse (Google BigQuery) using Fivetran. Transformed the data using dbt (Data Build Tool) and created visuals and dashboards in Looker Studio for efficient data analysis and reporting.

### Optimization Application - Flight Assignment

Developed an optimization model using Excel and Python to assign flights to pilots and copilots while minimizing operating costs. Utilized pyomo and glpk to build and solve the optimization problem, ensuring efficient resource allocation.

### House Prices Prediction (Kaggle competition)

Participated in a Kaggle competition to predict house prices. Built and compared several machine learning models, including GLM, Bagging and Boosting models, Random Forest, and Neural Networks. Tuned the models to achieve the best performance with the least R-Squared error.

### COVID-19 Dashboard

Designed and set up a Tableau dashboard to visualize COVID-19 key performance indicators (KPIs) such as positive count and death count. Leveraged calculated fields and parameters to create interactive and informative visualizations.

### Prediction Problem - Death Risks Prediction based on Smoking Habits

Addressed a prediction problem using SAS, focusing on predicting death risks based on smoking habits. Employed generalized linear models, specifically negative binomial regression, to analyze the impact of smoking on mortality rates.

### Customer Segmentation and Lifetime Value Analysis

Conducted clustering analysis to identify distinct customer groups based on behavior and preferences. Developed a customer segmentation model and calculated customer lifetime value (CLTV) to prioritize high-value customers and optimize marketing strategies for customer retention.

### Predictive Maintenance for Manufacturing Equipment

Built a predictive maintenance model using sensor data and machine learning algorithms. Implemented anomaly detection techniques and developed predictive models to optimize maintenance schedules and reduce equipment downtime.

### Demand Forecasting and Inventory Optimization

Developed time series forecasting models such as SARIMA and Prophet to accurately predict demand for different product categories. Optimized inventory levels based on demand forecasts, effectively minimizing stockouts and excess inventory costs.
