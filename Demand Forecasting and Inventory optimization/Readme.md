# Demand Forecasting and Inventory Optimization

## Project Summary

### Introduction
This project focuses on developing time series forecasting models for demand forecasting and optimizing inventory levels. By accurately predicting demand for different product categories and optimizing inventory, businesses can reduce stockouts while minimizing excess inventory costs. The project showcases my expertise in time series analysis, forecasting techniques, and inventory optimization.

### Key Steps

1. Data Exploration and Preparation:
   - Analyzed the historical demand data to understand the patterns, seasonality, and trends associated with different product categories.
   - Prepared the data by handling missing values, performing data cleaning, and transforming variables for further analysis.

2. Time Series Forecasting:
   - Developed time series forecasting models, such as SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) or Prophet, to accurately predict demand for different product categories.
   - Evaluated and fine-tuned the models using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE) or mean absolute error (MAE), to improve forecasting accuracy.

3. Inventory Optimization:
   - Utilized the demand forecasts to optimize inventory levels based on desired service levels and cost considerations.
   - Implemented inventory optimization techniques, such as reorder point calculation, safety stock determination, or economic order quantity (EOQ) analysis, to ensure optimal inventory levels while minimizing stockouts and excess inventory costs.

### Conclusion
This project showcases my expertise in time series analysis, demand forecasting, and inventory optimization. By accurately predicting demand and optimizing inventory levels, businesses can achieve better inventory management, reduce stockouts, and minimize costs associated with excess inventory.
