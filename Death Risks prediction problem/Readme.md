# Prediction Problem - Death Risks Prediction

## Project Summary

### Introduction
This project focuses on predicting death risks based on smoking habits using a generalized linear model (negative binomial regression). The goal was to develop a predictive model that could estimate the likelihood of death based on smoking-related factors. The project showcases my expertise in statistical modeling, data analysis, and predictive modeling.

### Key Steps

1. Data Exploration and Preparation:
   - Analyzed the dataset to understand the variables and their relationships with death risks.
   - Prepared the data by handling missing values, data cleaning, and feature selection.

2. Model Development:
   - Utilized SAS software to develop a generalized linear model (GLM) using the negative binomial regression technique.
   - Formulated the model to predict death risks based on smoking habits and other relevant factors.

3. Model Evaluation and Performance:
   - Evaluated the model's performance using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Conducted statistical tests and analyzed model coefficients to understand the impact of smoking habits on death risks.

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates my skills in statistical modeling, data analysis, and predictive modeling by developing a model to predict death risks based on smoking habits. The model provides insights into the relationship between smoking and mortality, highlighting the importance of smoking cessation for improving health outcomes.
